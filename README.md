Welcome to the Pinterest Clone repository! This project is a simplified version of the popular social media platform Pinterest, designed to provide users with basic features for sharing and discovering content.

<h3>Description:</h3>
Pinterest Clone is a web application inspired by Pinterest, offering users a familiar interface for browsing, uploading, and sharing images and content.

     - User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.
     - Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, including profile picture and bio.
     - Feed: The feed displays a curated selection of posts uploaded by users, allowing users to discover new content.
     - Upload Posts: Users can upload images and create posts to share with others.

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
     - Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building the backend of the application.
     - EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating language used for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript, facilitating dynamic content rendering in the application.
     - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing server-side code and powering the backend of the application.
